description: "This work reviews the recent advances in emerging memristive devices for artificial neuron and synapse applications, including memory and data-processing ability: the physics and characteristics are discussed first, i.e., valence changing, electrochemical metallization, phase changing, interfaced-controlling, charge-trapping, ferroelectric tunnelling, and spin-transfer torquing. Next, we propose a universal benchmark for the artificial synapse and neuron devices on spiking energy consumption, standby power consumption, and spike timing. Based on the benchmark, we address the challenges, suggest the guidelines for intra-device and inter-device design, and provide an outlook for the neuromorphic applications of resistive switching-based artificial neuron and synapse devices."

The "Best Paper Award" went to Diing Shenp Ang from Nanyang Technological University for his contribution "Silicon FET Reservoir for Dynamic Edge Vision". The paper impresses with an impressively simple approach to using hysteresis in SI FETs for hardware-based and highly efficient image and video classification. Professor Ang follows last year's winner Tom Enderlein from the Center for Microtechnologies at Chemnitz University of Technology with the Best Paper Award 2023 for his contribution "Hollow Microneedle Fabrication and Characterization for Interstitial Fluid Extraction in Minimally Invasive Sensors". The "Best Poster Award" goes to Ahmed Shaaban from Infineon Technologies AG Munich for "Resonate-and-Fire Spiking Neurons for Target Detection and Hand Gesture Recognition: A Hybrid Approach".
