## [News](https://www.smart-systems-integration.org/event/smart-systems-integration-ssi-2024)

The "Best Paper Award" went to Diing Shenp Ang from Nanyang Technological University for his contribution "Silicon FET Reservoir for Dynamic Edge Vision". The paper impresses with an impressively simple approach to using hysteresis in SI FETs for hardware-based and highly efficient image and video classification. Professor Ang follows last year's winner Tom Enderlein from the Center for Microtechnologies at Chemnitz University of Technology with the Best Paper Award 2023 for his contribution "Hollow Microneedle Fabrication and Characterization for Interstitial Fluid Extraction in Minimally Invasive Sensors". The "Best Poster Award" goes to Ahmed Shaaban from Infineon Technologies AG Munich for "Resonate-and-Fire Spiking Neurons for Target Detection and Hand Gesture Recognition: A Hybrid Approach".

## About the SSI 2024

The Smart Systems Integration Conference & Exhibition â€“ SSI 2024 took place from 16-18 April 2024 in Hamburg, Germany, back-to-back with the apcm conference.


In addition to high-level keynotes from the European Commission and leading research institutions, again experts in Smart Systems integrations from industry and academia will gather to present their latest results and to commonly shape next generations of smart systems made in Europe. As proven successful, conference tracks will be organised oriented along the value chain of smart systems:


* Component developments for Smart Systems
* System integration aspects concerning hardware and software
* Applications: Mobility, Energy, Industry, Biomedical, Healthy Living
